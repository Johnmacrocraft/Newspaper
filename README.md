When you translate, remember these rules:
- NEVER add words that don't even exist on the original. By _adding words_, we mean something like this:<br />
Original: An error has occurred.<br />
Bad translation: An error has occurred. _**Please report this problem to the issue tracker.**_<br />
There's no need to translate exceedingly liberally like that; that's not what the translators should do.
- NEVER translate if you DON'T know how to translate, especially with machine translators.
- In most cases, translations should be translated literally. Do NOT add words without my consent. If there's something that should be translated liberally, please ask me before doing it.
