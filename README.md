When you translate, remember the following rules:
- NEVER add words and punctuation marks that don't even exist on the original. By _adding these_, we mean something like this:<br />
Original: An error has occurred<br />
Bad translation: An error has occurred. Please report this problem to the issue tracker.<br />
There's no need to translate exceedingly liberally like that; that's not what the translators should do.
- NEVER translate if you DON'T know how to translate, especially with machine translators.
- Translate liberally if the translation is better with it, but don't abuse it too much. If there's something that should be translated liberally, please ask me before doing it.<br />
- Translate with your language's grammar rules followed and consistency.
